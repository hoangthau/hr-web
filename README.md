### Components

We should design and implement all common UI components for our app. So we will have a design system for our product.

- `Button`: We will use Button component for all buttons in our app to have consistent style. For example: Close, Save, Update button.

- `Modal`: Open Modal to update an employee
- `Switch`: Show and change status of employee
- `Table`: Display all employees with columns and rows
- `TextInput`: Display and change employee infomation like name, email as text input
- Other components: We will use `Form` component to change employee info inside Modal. `Employees` component as page to handle all things related to employees: list of employees, update an employee

Beside that I decided to implement some extra things as follows:

- Redux: to store employees data, to get, fetch and update employee via store.
- Simple form validation when user updates an employee inside Modal.
- Responsive layout for mobile devices
- Some unit tests for UI components
- Using async action and simulate API call to fetch employees data
